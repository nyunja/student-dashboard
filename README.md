# Student Profile Dashboard

A dynamic web application designed to provide students with a clear overview of their academic progress, including XP (Experience Points), completed exercises, average grades, and skill development, fetched from a GraphQL API. The dashboard is built with a focus on modularity, maintainability, and a responsive user experience.

## âœ¨ Features

* **User Authentication:** Secure login functionality to access the dashboard.
* **Interactive Dashboard:**
    * **Stats Cards:** Display real-time total XP, completed exercises, and average grade.
    * **XP Progress Chart:** Visualize XP accumulation over weekly, monthly, or yearly periods (currently mocked, but ready for real data).
    * **Recent Exercises Table:** List recently completed exercises with grades.
    * **Skills Progress:** Track proficiency in various skills with progress bars.
* **User Profile View:** A dedicated page displaying comprehensive personal information fetched from the user's GraphQL attributes.
* **Client-Side Routing (SPA):** Seamless navigation between dashboard and profile views without full page reloads, implemented using a custom router.
* **Dark/Light Mode Toggle:** Persistent theme preference with a user-friendly toggle.
* **Modular JavaScript Architecture:** Clean, organized codebase using ES6 modules for improved readability, maintainability, and scalability.
* **GraphQL Integration:** Fetches all dynamic data (user info, XP, exercises, skills) from a GraphQL endpoint.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** Styling, including CSS variables for easy theming (light/dark mode).
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Core application logic, modular design.
    * Custom `AuthService` for authentication.
    * Custom `GraphQLService` for API interactions.
    * Custom `Router` for client-side navigation.
    * Modularized components for UI elements (e.g., `StatsCard`, `ThemeManager`, `Sidebar`).
* **GraphQL:** For efficient data querying.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The JavaScript codebase is highly modularized for clarity and maintainability:
